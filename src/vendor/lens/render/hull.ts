 * and on a page of vertical text that residue reads as streaks running the full
 * height of a bubble. Covering it needs a shape, and the paragraph's bounding
 * box is the wrong one: for columns set at an angle, or a bubble whose lines
 * are ragged, a rectangle takes in far more than the text and an ellipse
 * inscribed in it takes in too little at the corners.
 *
 * The hull of every line box's corners is exactly the text's extent, whatever
 * arrangement the lines are in.
