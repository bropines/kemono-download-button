/**
 * Everything that differs between userscript hosts.
 *
 * Tampermonkey is the reference implementation, but AdGuard ships a userscript
 * engine of its own (Extensions -> Add extension) and it differs in four ways
 * that reach this script:
 *
 * 1. `GM_registerMenuCommand` may not exist. Calling it is a TypeError that
 *    aborts the rest of the bundle.
 * 2. It may run scripts in the page's own context rather than a sandbox, which
 *    is why nothing may rely on a private global.
 * 3. Its `GM_xmlhttpRequest` has been loose about `responseType` (CoreLibs
 *    #1983), reports a status through `onerror`, and no host documents which
 *    shapes of request *body* it accepts.
 * 4. Its storage persists only what GM4 promises - strings, numbers, booleans.
 *
 * And which of those apply is not readable from `GM_info`: one build has the
 * menu and sandboxes, another has neither. A version behaves how it behaves, so
 * every difference below is settled by feature detection, by writing to the
 * narrowest contract, or by trying and falling back.
